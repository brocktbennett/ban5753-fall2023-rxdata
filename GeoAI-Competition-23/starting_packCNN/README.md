## Executive Summary üìú

The challenge involves automating the estimation of essential soil parameters‚Äîpotassium, phosphorus, magnesium, and pH‚Äîfrom hyperspectral data gathered over agricultural regions in Poland. After performing data transformations, the LightGBM model emerged as the most effective solution.

The potential of hyperspectral technology and advanced machine learning to optimize agriculture applications will have cascading benefits in addressing contemporary challenges related to water scarcity, food security, and environmental impacts. Further benefits may be gleaned from further enhancing resolution and accuracy within specific wavelength ranges for a more nuanced understanding of soil parameters, contributing to improved sustainable agriculture practices.

Insights gained from the analysis of key spectral features influencing soil parameter estimations guide future applications. A broad scope into our insights and recommendations is that all soil parameters aside from magnesium are highly significant in making predictions.

## Introduction üå±

ESA Œ¶-lab, in collaboration with KP Labs and their partner QZ Solutions, has launched an extraordinary initiative to transform agriculture's future by leveraging in-orbit processing. The primary goal is to enhance farm sustainability by utilizing the latest advancements in Earth observation and artificial intelligence. This approach helps address the challenge of affordable food production and contributes to environmentally friendly agriculture practices.

One of the critical aspects is providing farmers with timely information about soil parameters to optimize their fertilization processes. This optimization can lead to selecting more suitable fertilizer mixes and reducing overall fertilizer usage. Currently, the traditional method for quantifying soil parameters is labor-intensive and time-consuming. It involves collecting soil samples in the field and sending them to specialize labs for chemical analysis. Moreover, the limited number of sampling points in the field, often spread across large areas, needs to be improved to ensure the accuracy of test results. In-situ analysis could be more scalable and more time-inefficient.

The proposed solution is to harness innovative airborne and satellite hyperspectral imaging technology to promote more sustainable agriculture practices, contributing to a better future for our planet.

## Project Objectives üöÄ

The AI for Good initiative, led by ITU in collaboration with 40 UN Sister Agencies, is dedicated to harnessing the power of artificial intelligence to advance the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals on a global scale. As the premier action-oriented UN platform on AI, its mission is to identify practical applications that drive positive impact. This challenge specifically focuses on advancing soil parameter retrieval from hyperspectral data to prepare for the upcoming Intuition-1 mission.

## Data Introduction/Sourcing üìä

To train the machine learning model, ground truth samples were collected for each soil parameter. The model will identify which unique features, or bandwidths, have associations with each parameter. The dataset consists of 2886 patches that are, on average, 60 by 60 pixels. Each pixel within the patch contains readings for 150 wavelength bands (462-942 nm). An example image of Band 100 is presented in the Appendix in Figure 1.

The distributions of each soil parameter were plotted and are presented below:

## Data Preparation üßπ

During data exploration, it was discovered that the distributions of some soil parameters were skewed. Since these are target variables, it is not recommended to perform power series transformations; however, Yeo-Johnson transformations were performed on predictor variables. These transformations can help achieve better accuracy in predicting the target variables.

Predictor and target variables were scaled before initializing the model, ensuring all variables are in the same scale. This prevents higher magnitudes from biasing the model and lessens the impact of outliers.

## Data Visualizations üìä

*Please see Visualizations and Figures in the Appendix*

## Data Analysis üìà

Chemometric models are used to reveal trends in chemical data; in this case, calibrating spectral data. Models that were considered included Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and the Light Gradient Boosting Model (LightGBM).

Partial Regression: Initially, PLS proved to be one of the best-performing, simplest models.

Support Vector Regression: SVR was explored as another model. This model attempts to find a hyperplane in the dataset that results in a minimum error between training and predicted values.

Convolutional Neural Networks: CNN is a deep learning framework often used in image classification and works well for hyperspectral matrices.

Light Gradient Boosting: The last chemometric model to be evaluated was the LightGBM regression model.

Distributions of training soil parameter values compared to predicted values were plotted.
