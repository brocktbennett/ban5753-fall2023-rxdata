**UPDATE: December 7, 2023**

### Current State

- Wrapped up Mini Project #2, primarily focusing on wrapping up the Humana and GeoAI papers for submission
- Our only concerning part throughout the whole process is trimming down the report to fit the page length
- Trying to decipher what is worth to keep and what is not

### Humana

- We would say we are 75% of the way done
- Will be 100% by Thursday

### GeoAI 

- We would say we are 60% of the way done
- Will be 100% by the weekend
- We are working on wrapping up the GeoAI paper simultaneously with the Humana one

**UPDATE: November 26, 2023**

### Current State

- Our primary focus is getting the Mini Project 2 completed by this upcoming Wednesday
- Making the report for the Mini Project 2 instead of a PPT
- Using the Random Forest, XGBOOST, and Gradient Boosting as our model types
- As well as attempting to knock out the k-means clustering

### GeoAI Challenge [Click here](https://github.com/osu-msba/ban5753-fall2023-rxdata/blob/main/GeoAI-Competition-23/starting_packCNN/README.md)

- We are still tweaking the report here and there, feel more confident in the report for GeoAI than for Humana

### Humana [Click here](https://github.com/osu-msba/ban5753-fall2023-rxdata/blob/main/Humana-Mays%20Competition/README.md)

- We are still tweaking the report as we feel they are more adjustments that need to be made after writing up a report for the GeoAI challenge
- As well as fit the rubric necessary for the class

**UPDATE: November 13, 2023**

### Current State

- Completed the report for the GeoAI Challenge
- Ran it through Grammarly before submission and converted it to PDF instead of a Word file
- The report is about 24 pages, including the reference page
- Assumed that GMT meant Mountain Time, so an hour behind CST, but it means Greenwich Mean Time, which is 6 hours ahead
- Got it all in before the time and submitted our model code for the GeoAI challenge
- Had initial trouble trying to submit the PDF file for the report and realized that the submission for the report and model code is only for those in the top 10
- Unfortunately, we did not make the top 10, but they have our model code and report

### Humana

- Writing the report for the GeoAI challenge it helped us better understand what we should tweak in the Humana report
- Taking notes of the stuff we did well and not so well in the Humana report and actively adjusting it for our benefit

**UPDATE: November 5, 2023**

### Current State

- Fine-tuning our model as well as the report as it is due next Sunday, the 12th
- Going to run the report for the GeoAI Challenge through Grammarly before submission
- Currently 22nd on the leaderboard with a root mean square error of 0.287144200

### Humana

- Still working on the report for the Humana project
- Trying to make it suitable for the class in the lengths of both the paper and appendix

**UPDATE: October 30, 2023**

### GeoAI Challenge

- We have experimented with multiple model types for the competition: SVR, Partial Regression, CNN
- CNN has been our best model type as it has gotten us to our ranking of 20th
- The score of the competition is based on the root mean square error in the model, and we are at 0.288476715
- Here is the link to the leaderboard: https://zindi.africa/competitions/geoai-challenge-estimating-soil-parameters-from-hyperspectral-images/leaderboard
- We are going by MTTDATA in this project instead of RxData

**UPDATE: October 29, 2023**

### Current State: GeoAI Challenge

- Decided to move forward with the GeoAI Competition (The Hyperspectral Imaging) as our alternate in place of Adobe
- Getting off to a hot start by already utilizing the submission leaderboard and currently in 20th place
- The competition is due November 12th at 11:59 GMT, with the model predictions, code, and report all together
- Working on the model predictions and code, and have started the skeleton of the report and adding to it as we go

### Humana

- Unfortunately, we did not make it to the next round, but happy that we made it to the second round
- However, we are looking to finish out the project strong with a fantastic report
- Currently, we are still tweaking the report and looking to cut it down to fit the page maximum for both the report and appendix
- All of that in mind without cutting the steak and sizzle from it

**UPDATE: October 22, 2023**

### Current State
- The Adobe Analytics Competition has been postponed until early 2024
- Have looked into alternate projects in place of Adobe
- Looked at a project from drivendata.org that was called "Water Supply Forecast Rodeo: Development Arena"
- Thought it was a good project, but after a second consideration, we decided not to go through with it as our project
- Another project we looked at was from Kaggle, and that dealt with image processing on Ovarian Cancer
- However, we have not decided to go through with that one either

**UPDATE: October 16, 2023**

### The Report

- We finished the report on Sunday 10/15 at around 10:30 pm last night
- Put in many insights and recommendations
- Our report was about 20 pages

### Recap of Last Week

- Crafted the report
- Developed key visualizations to generate insights and recommendations
- Put the finishing touches on the Analysis portion
- Struggled a bit, so could not get it to where it was optimal

**UPDATE: October 9, 2023**

### Recap of Last Week

- Miraculously made it to the 2nd round
- Our submission was not processing, but it did on the very last day
- Submitted almost everyday the past week
- At first, submitted a dummy random set to get a submission in

**UPDATE: October 1, 2023**

### Modeling

- We're able to get the basic form of our model up and running
- The modeling scheme that worked for us is LightGBM
- We still need to implemenet PCAs and Merged data into it
- How to work PCA into our model?

### Team Morale

- It was a great sense of relief to get the model up and running

 **UPDATE: September 30, 2023**

### Team Struggles

- It has taken a bit longer to get the model up and running
- We have put in the time but to no avail
- Have held 3+ hour meetings on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, but we seem to be going in circles
- Any advice you can give us would be very helpful. We very much want your input
  
### Null Values

- To handle our Null Values, we relabeled the missing values with "Unknown." We conducted the relabeling process during the data cleaning stage as we relabeling the binary values

### Modeling

- Initially, we tried Gradient Boosting for our Modeling scheme, but our code would take hours to run to get nothing
- Switched to LightGBM cause it is more of an efficient Modeling scheme, but that does not seem to work
- Using Python as our coding language
- A common problem we faced was that the dataset was too large since we merged our data into one big dataset, so we decided to make some adjustments to make it smaller
- Another problem we faced was that the code needed to be binary instead of the phrasing we relabeled it as. It seems like the code only reads numeric values.  It set us back a bit
- Our main focus for the next is to get a model up and running and to put something on the board. Hopefully, we can submit it one time a date before October 6th, but at least before the deadline.
- We would love some thorough expertise that relays to our modeling scheme in class

### Next Steps

- We are aware that it is optimal to get something up on the leaderboard, but we are stuck
- We would like to preface that the team is fine amongst each other. It is just nervous energy as we would like to have more progress at this time

**UPDATE: November 12th, 2023**

### Team Roles

- Brock: Programming (Python) and Data Visualizations
- Nathan: Data Cleaning (SAS) and Analysis
- Bella: Data Visualizations and Interpretation
- John: Research and Analysis

### Initial Research

- Looking at what the research is saying to get further context about our topic
- Wanted to get a headstart on the research
- Helping us utilize the research to gain further insights into how to move forward in the project

### Problem Statement and Analysis

- Have been able to get a good sense of the project and the problem at hand
- Know what the project is trying to solve
- Looking to solidify a proper way to tackle the issue of the data

### Null Values

- How we are going to deal with Null Values is on a case-by-case basis
- Going to take out those data points that are just IDs
- Going to work around those with only some nulls

### Modeling

- Looking at going towards a LightGBM or Gradient Boosting for our model selection for the project
- Does it matter how many columns you have when you are doing Gradient Boosting?

### Disparity Index

- Trying to get that solved, but we have other priorities within the data figured out first

### Initial Thoughts about the Data

- A lot of data at once, hard to dissect what way we should lean towards
- Have a great understanding of the data dictionary of the variables of the data
- Dealing with Factor Analysis
